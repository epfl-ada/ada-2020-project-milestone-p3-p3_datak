For a person of normal weight consuming about 2000 Kcal per day:
•	11.5% protein **(1)
•	<5% sugars (2)
•	<30% fat (2)
•	<10% saturate (2)
•	~50% carbs
•	>3% fiber(3) 
**Calculs made: The recommended intake of protein is 0.83g/Kg body weight(1).
To obtain the calorie intake at the nutrient level, we used the conversion factors set by EU directive 90/496/EEC41: 4 kcal for proteins and carbohydrates, and 2kcal for fibers.
We then considered a 69Kg(4) average body weight for a resident of UK. We then obtained 0.83g/Kg x 69Kg x 4Kcal/g = 229 Kcal wich give us a 11.5% over a mean intake of 2000Kcal/day.

#verifying that representativeness and indicators are not correlated: for exemple rich people (high income)
#could buy more at Tesco than other people

results






The idea was to study if an alcohol consumption could be influenced by some social caracteristics of an area.
To do so, we decided to use several indicators given by the Office for National Statistics of UK:
    Unemployment Rate: % of unemployed people in a given area
    Mean Annual Household Income estimate: Given in £ for each area
    Median Annual Household Income estimate:  Given in £ for each area 
    No Qualification:  % of people without qualification in a given area
    High Qualification:  % of people with level of qualification of 4 or above in a given area
    
  In order to show and quantify possibles influences, we computed spearman correlations between the quantity (in g) of alcohol in a typical product of an area and indicators decribed above.
  PLOT
  The results are indeed a bit surprising. Contrary to popular belief where we could expect positive correlations between a high consumption of alcohol for poor or less educated people,
  our datas are showing the opposite: rich and educated people seem to consume more alcohol. On way of interpreting such results could be to consider that alcohol products are generally expensive 
  so rich people can afford to consume alcohol drinks while more precarious people only buy primary products.
  
  Now let's visually verify our results

df_representativ['Mean Annual Household Income estimate (£)'].describe()
#75% of richer people
rich = df_representativ.loc[(df_representativ['Mean Annual Household Income estimate (£)'] > 53719)]
#25% of poorest people
poor = df_representativ.loc[(df_representativ['Mean Annual Household Income estimate (£)'] < 34255)]
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plot1=sns.distplot(rich.alcohol)
plot1.set_label('rich people')
plot2=sns.distplot(poor.alcohol, label = 'poor people')

So now we can easily underline that porr people (orange) consume less alcohol than rich (blue) people
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
SUITE CORRELATION AVEC FACTEURS SOCIAUX  

Great! We have succesfully found which areas are closer to Macronutrient recommendations for a good health. Now, let's correlate these results with some social indicators. 

#Exemple of observable correlation
fig = px.scatter(df_representativ, x='High Qualification(%)',y='energy_sugar',title='Exemple of observable correlation ')
fig.show()

As we can observe in this plot, macronutrient intakes like sugar seems correlated to social indicators as a High level of Qualification. Let's verify it. 
To do so we used the same indicators as the ones described above for alcohol consumption and tried to correlate them to intakes of Macronutrients.
With the score previously computed, which represents the trend of an area a good diet, we now are going to try to corrolate it with social indicators by doing spearmann correlations.
