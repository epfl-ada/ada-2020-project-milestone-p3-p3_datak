For a person of normal weight consuming about 2000 Kcal per day:
•	11.5% protein **(1)
•	<5% sugars (2)
•	<30% fat (2)
•	<10% saturate (2)
•	~50% carbs
•	>3% fiber(3) 
**Calculs made: The recommended intake of protein is 0.83g/Kg body weight(1).
To obtain the calorie intake at the nutrient level, we used the conversion factors set by EU directive 90/496/EEC41: 4 kcal for proteins and carbohydrates, and 2kcal for fibers.
We then considered a 69Kg(4) average body weight for a resident of UK. We then obtained 0.83g/Kg x 69Kg x 4Kcal/g = 229 Kcal wich give us a 11.5% over a mean intake of 2000Kcal/day.

The idea was to study if an alcohol consumption could be influenced by some social caracteristics of an area.
To do so, we decided to use several indicators given by the Office for National Statistics of UK:
    Unemployment Rate: % of unemployed people in a given area
    Mean Annual Household Income estimate: Given in £ for each area
    Median Annual Household Income estimate:  Given in £ for each area 
    No Qualification:  % of people without qualification in a given area
    High Qualification:  % of people with level of qualification of 4 or above in a given area
    
  In order to show and quantify possibles influences, we computed spearman correlations between the quantity (in g) of alcohol in a typical product of an area and indicators decribed above.
  PLOT
  The results are indeed a bit surprising. Contrary to popular belief where we could expect positive correlations between a high consumption of alcohol for poor or less educated people,
  our datas are showing the opposite: rich and educated people seem to consume more alcohol. On way of interpreting such results could be to consider that alcohol products are generally expensive 
  so rich people can afford to consume alcohol drinks while more precarious people only buy primary products.
