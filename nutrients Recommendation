For a person of normal weight consuming about 2000 Kcal per day:
•	11.5% protein **(1)
•	<5% sugars (2)
•	<30% fat (2)
•	<10% saturate (2)
•	~50% carbs
•	>3% fiber(3) 
**Calculs made: The recommended intake of protein is 0.83g/Kg body weight(1).
To obtain the calorie intake at the nutrient level, we used the conversion factors set by EU directive 90/496/EEC41: 4 kcal for proteins and carbohydrates, and 2kcal for fibers.
We then considered a 69Kg(4) average body weight for a resident of UK. We then obtained 0.83g/Kg x 69Kg x 4Kcal/g = 229 Kcal wich give us a 11.5% over a mean intake of 2000Kcal/day.
